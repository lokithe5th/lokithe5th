## lourens  
- I'm a multifaceted Solidity Developer with special interests in DeFi and Smart Contract Security.
- I love learning and hold a Masters in Business Administration, with an undergad Bachelors of Science.
- I enjoy the combination of finance and programming that smart contracts require.

## Experience 
My experience crosses multiple domains: from being a registered health professional, to founding an Agritech startup, to being a Solidity Developer with mainnet contracts in production.   

Aside from solidity development and smart contract auditing my interest is focused on how I could integrate smart contracts and business system design in the best way.
