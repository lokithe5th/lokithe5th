## Experience 👨🏻‍🎓
The bulk of my experience is as a Solidity Developer for [Daoism Systems](https://daoism.systems/), building out a custom DAO ecosystem as part of a small team. At the end of September 2022 I was asked to become Project Owner for this project, under the guidance of the company Technical Lead.  

Prior to this I was part of BuidlGuidl and developed smart contracts with the goal of becoming a Solidity Developer in the web3 space; making a transition from being a health professional and business manager towards a developer after obtaining my Masters in Business Administration in 2020.  

My interest has been focused on coordination systems, and how I could integrate smart contracts and business system design in the best way.
